# MagicMirror

This is a side project where I'm planning on building a magic mirror that will run on a Raspberry Pi 3. 

The idea is that the mirror will be displaying some simple information such as the current date and time, weather, bitcoin exchange rate and maybe some currency exchange, as well as a motivational quote each day. 

The display will be a simple web server built in React, running on localhost:3000

[Michael Teeuw's Blog](http://michaelteeuw.nl/post/84026273526/and-there-it-is-the-end-result-of-the-magic) is a great resource to see how such a project would work. 

Currently, the web server can display the current date and time, as well as some basic information about the weather. 
I will keep this README.md up to date with my progress :)
